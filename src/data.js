You can’t overdose by touching fentanyl, but ingesting even a small amount can be deadly. Fortunately, there are ways to protect yourself."

Illicit fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that can be extremely dangerous when ingested. Naloxone is a nasal spray that can reverse an opioid overdose. Carrying naloxone is one of many precautions you can take to stay safe."
